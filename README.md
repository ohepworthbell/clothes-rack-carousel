# Clothes Rack Carousel
A simple carousel with a clothes' rack style of movement with very basic responsiveness. Animations are done using CSS3, switching is done in JavaScript (jQuery depenency, working on vanilla version).

### Demo
Coming soon...

### To do
* Add demo to README.md (demo gif already in demo folder)
* Change jQuery to vanilla JS - there is no real jQuery dependency, so using it is redundant
* Improve multiple swipe bug - carousel gets bug and glitches
* Improve responsive nature - allow custom numbers of t-shirt items and percent widths of clothes
