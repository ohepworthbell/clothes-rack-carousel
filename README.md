# Clothes Rack Carousel
A simple carousel with a clothes' rack style of movement with very basic responsiveness. Animations are done using CSS3, switching is done in JavaScript (jQuery depenency, working on vanilla version). [ View demo ](http://ohepworthbell.github.io/projects/clothes-rack-carousel/)

### Overview
![Animated gif demo of carousel](http://ohepworthbell.github.io/clothes-rack-carousel/img/demo.gif)


### To do
* Change jQuery to vanilla JS - there is no real jQuery dependency, so using it is redundant
* Improve multiple swipe bug - when quickly swiping, carousel glitches and repidly resets animations
* Improve responsive nature - allow custom numbers of t-shirt items and percent widths of clothes on hanger
* Wrap responsive features, navigation, etc. in function for easier implementation
* Any other suggestions welcome :)
