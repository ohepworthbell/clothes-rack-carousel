### To do
* Change jQuery to vanilla JS - there is no real jQuery dependency, so using it is redundant
* Improve multiple swipe bug - when quickly swiping, carousel glitches and repidly resets animations
* Improve responsive nature - allow custom numbers of t-shirt items and percent widths of clothes on hanger
* Wrap responsive features, navigation, etc. in function for easier implementation
